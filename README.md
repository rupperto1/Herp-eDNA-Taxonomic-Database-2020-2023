# Herp-eDNA-Tissue-Database-2020-2023
### These are the alignment and taxonomy files used for both 12S and 16S markers for Olivia Ruppert's (graduate student) project. Using the Mothur bioinformatic pipeline, it was not possible to run these files with herpetofauna only. This is due to longer sequences (such as human) that inevitably will be present in samples. When Mothur reads these sequences, but cannot fit them to an alignment file with only short sequences (herpetofauna only), it gives an error message. ###

#### For tissue collaborators, if you wish to see only your sample sequences, please refer to the tables provided in your individual tissue reports with codes for your samples and they can be found in the files on this repository. ###
